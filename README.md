# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

My task was to write a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where a user can play against the computer.

The user should enter rock, paper, or scissors (remember to account for differences in capitalization!), 
and the computer will choose a random value.
After each turn display the score (user wins vs. computer wins).
Whichever player reaches five wins first is the winner!
